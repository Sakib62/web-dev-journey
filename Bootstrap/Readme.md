### Wireframing

- low fidelity design

mockup -> high fidelity .. icon, color, img

explore - layout, ui patterns

sketch -> illustrator?

prototype -> animated version

Navbar

- similar to div but more specific

section

Bootstrap

- pre styled component
- responsive design (response to the size of the screen/viewport)

more short, syntax in other framwork?
